* Overview
*******************************************************************************/

An LED is connected to a microcontroller. The LED switches between on and off
at a regular fixed length of time. That's all the microcontroller does. Like
Seinfeld reruns at 2 AM on channel four, it never stops, it never changes, and
it is forever predictable.

technical note: length of time is a compile-time constant in milliseconds

/*******************************************************************************
* Usage Scenario
*******************************************************************************/

Billy provides power to the MCU via a USB connection to his computer. The MCU
takes a split second to configure itself and immediately begins blinking. Billy
is entranced by the glorious red light. The red reminds him of communism. He
enters a deeply hypnotic state. He attains nirvana.
